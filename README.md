# otp-crypt

This tool encrypts data with OTP (TOTP) protection

> Disclaimer: OTP - it's just an additional step to a little increase protection of encrypted data. If the intruder has encryption key + talent to debug binary or just analyze this source code, then he will be able to bypass OTP protection.
